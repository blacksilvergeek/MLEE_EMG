## document notes
You will be using data consisting of signals collected from MYO Thalmic bracelets worn on usersâ€™ forearms. 
The bracelet is equipped with eight sensors equally spaced around the forearm that simultaneously acquire myographic signals. 



The raw EMG data for **36 subjects** are recorded while they performed series of static hand gestures. 

The subjects perform two series, each of which consists of six (seven) basic gestures. 

Each gesture was performed for 3 seconds with a pause of 3 seconds between gestures.
